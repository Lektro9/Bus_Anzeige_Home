#Bus_Anzeige_Home

This is an App for Django which uses the following Python3 modules:

pip3 install requests
pip3 install bs4
This App scrapes information from buslines near our home (vrs.de) and gives back the planned departure and (if there are any) delays in a "materialized" view to the frontend. For privacy-reasons my busstops were changed.
